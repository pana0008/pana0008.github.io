    <p>
      Moving and studying in a foreign country has always been a dream of mine ever since I was little,
      which was really suprising for someone who has always been socially anxious. But I knew that this
      experience would break me out of my shell and help me grow into an independent and responsible adult.
      <br>
      <br>
      It wasn't always clear to me what I wanted to study, because I had so many things that I was interested in
      and wanted to learn more about, but I knew I had to choose only one as my future career.
      And since I was always on the computer one of my choices was something with that! To be more specific I wanted to
      study game development and I started getting into it in 4th grade but I was really overwhelmed by it and didn't
      even know where to start so I didn't even try learning something about it because I thought that I wasn't smart
      enough
      for it.
      <br>
      <br>
      So for a few years I had no idea where or what I was going to study.
      But during an Erasmus project in Zarazoga, Spain in the summer of 2022 I discovered that programming is not so
      scary after all.
      We only learnt a little bit of HTML and CSS but it was so fun. So I decided to sign up for a Python Basics course
      in the autumn
      and there began my coding journey.
      <br>
      <br>
      During that same time I went to an event organized by a company called UNIFY, that helps future students from
      Bulgaria with
      applying to a university in the Netherlands. I was fascinated by all the different universities and different
      programmes that this
      country had to offer but I was most interested in HZ's ICT programme, because it covers the different languages
      and aspects of programming
      So that's how I made my choice and spent the last two years of high school keeping my grades up, practicing my
      English and preparing myself
      so I could apply to HZ University.

    <em>
      After completing the study
    </em>
  </h1>
  <p class="study-choice-text">
    After graduating I really hope to have built a strong foundation in programming. Even if it isn't immediately I really hope that someday
    I am able to find a job as a game developer, because that has always been my dream field.
